# Movie Poster Steps

## Step 1: Creative Brief
*(Commit message: "Completed creative brief")*

Before you open any AI tools, plan your vision. This is your anchor—return to it after every AI generation.

**Your Movie Choice:**  
- **Movie Title: Hunger Games**  
- **Why I chose this movie: It is my favorite movie. **  

**Core Emotion:**  
What ONE feeling should a viewer get from your poster? (Examples: wonder, fear, joy, excitement, mystery, tension, nostalgia)  
- **Core emotion:Intensity**  

**Essential Visual Element:**  
What ONE image, object, or visual MUST appear on your poster?  
- **Essential element: Katniss **  
- **Why this element: Because she is the protagonist.**  

**What NOT to Include:**  
What do you definitely NOT want? (This helps you evaluate AI outputs critically.)  
- **Avoid: Making the poster colorful and vibrant**  

**Color Palette:**  
- **Dominant color(s): gold and black**  
- **Accent color(s): darker shades of colors **  
- **Overall mood: dark** (warm/cool/muted/vibrant/dark/bright)  

**Composition:**  
- [X] Close-up (face/detail)  
- [ ] Wide shot (landscape/setting)  
- [ ] Medium shot (full figure)  
- [ ] Object/symbol centered  
- [ ] Character collage  

- **Focal point description: a 3/4 shot of Katniss (from her chest and up) with Peta in the back facing the opposite direction also 3/4 (a little faded and less noticeable)**

## Step 2: AI Generation – First Attempts
*(Commit message: "Documented first two AI attempts")*

Open Adobe Firefly. Generate images based on your creative brief, but remember: you're exploring possibilities, not looking for a final answer.

**Attempt 1:**  
- **My prompt: Make me a hunger Games movie poster (image). I want a close up 3/4 shot of Katniss in her black fire outfit from her chest and up. Behind her (a little faded and less noticeable) Peta is facing the other way and is also portrayed as a 3/4 shot. Main colors should be gold and black, accent colors should be darker shades of colors. I want the main mood to be intense and revolutionary.**  

- **What worked: The mood fits and the background resembles the movie**  
- **What didn't work:The characters were positioned strangely and they didn't really look like themselves.**  
- **What I'll change for next attempt: Ask the AI to reposition the characters. **  

**Attempt 2**  
- **My prompt: Make me a hunger Games movie poster (image). I want a close up 3/4 shot of Katniss in her black fire outfit from her chest and up facing to the left. Behind her (a little faded and less noticeable) Peta is facing to the right and is also portrayed as a 3/4 shot. Main colors should be gold and black, accent colors should be darker shades of colors. I want the main mood to be intense.**  

- **What worked: The characters are in the correct position**  
- **What didn't work: The characters are in strange stance/ **  
- **What I'll change for next attempt: make them standing straight**

## Step 3: AI Generation – Continued Iteration
*(Commit message: "Documented final AI attempts")*

Keep refining. Try at least two more meaningfully different directions.

**Attempt 3:Make me a hunger Games movie poster (image). I want a close up 3/4 shot of Katniss in her black fire outfit from her upper chest and up, facing to the left. Behind her (a little faded and less noticeable) Peta is facing to the right and is also portrayed as a 3/4 shot. both characters should be standing still with their arms alongside their body. Main colors should be gold and black, accent colors should be darker shades of colors. I want the main mood to be intense. the background is a destroyed city in warm brown shades. Add a mocking jay pin on katniss's chest and make the fire on her costume visible.  **  
- **My prompt:**  

- **What worked:characters are positioned well**  
- **What didn't work: the background no longer resembles the moivie**  
- **What I'll change for next attempt: change the background**  

**Attempt 4:Make me a hunger Games movie poster (image). I want a close up 3/4 shot of Katniss in her black fire outfit from her upper chest and up, facing to the left. Behind her (a little faded and less noticeable) Peta is facing to the right and is also portrayed as a 3/4 shot. both characters should be standing still with their arms alongside their body. Main colors should be gold and black, accent colors should be darker shades of colors. I want the main mood to be intense. the background is a destroyed city in warm brown shades. Add a mocking jay pin on katniss's chest and make the fire on her costume visible.  make a dark vignette around the background to make the characters pop. The title "The Hunger Games" should be on the bottom of the poster in gold**  
- **My prompt:**  

- **What worked: Katniss's uniform is perfect**  
- **What didn't work: the background is too light **  

**Final AI Image Selected:** (Which attempt? Why?: The third attempt: the characters are in the correct position and the rest of the details resemble the movie the most compared to the other ones.)

## Step 4: Photoshop Modifications
*(Commit message: "Added Photoshop modifications")*

Export your best AI generation and open it in Photoshop. You must make at least TWO intentional modifications. The AI gave you raw material—now make it yours.

**Modification Ideas:**
- Crop or reframe the image  
- Adjust colors, contrast, or brightness  
- Add the movie title (typography matters!)  
- Add a tagline  
- Combine elements from multiple AI generations  
- Remove unwanted elements  

**Your Modifications:**  
1.  
2.  
3. (optional)  

**Save your final poster as:** `final-poster.jpg` or `final-poster.png`  
**Drag your final poster file into your GitHub repo folder before committing.**

## Step 5: Reflection
*(Commit message: "Completed reflection")*

**How did your vision evolve?**  
Compare your original creative brief to your final poster. What changed? What stayed the same?  


**What decision are you most proud of that the AI didn't make for you?**  


**What would you do differently next time?**
